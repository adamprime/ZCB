Words have amazing power.

All my life I have loved reading gospel books like the scriptures, church magazines, and books from church history. The Spirit can have such a powerful influence on us as we read the gospel in written form.

Many of the books written by early church leaders and pioneers have incredible, faith-building stories and teachings. Because they were published so long ago, few continue to be in print today. (Or at least not available at a reasonable price.) It isn’t because the value of their words has changed. Publishing is a difficult business and major publishers of works by members of the Church of Jesus Christ tend to focus on new books over historical books.

Luckily many of these older books are in the public domain. This means they can be republished by anyone. 

In the early 2010s I decided I wanted to publish some of these classic LDS books. My background is in web development and education, which is a good combination in the world of ebooks. Over the years the catalog has expanded to include print and audiobooks as well. 

I was raised in Liberty, Missouri, a place with rich ties to church history. Zion’s Camp passed through the area close to my childhood home and the stories of Zion’s Camp and the way the Lord provided for his people have always been some of my favorites. My little publishing project became known as Zion’s Camp Books.

I love to hear feedback and suggestions as well as requests for books that are in the public domain. I can be contacted through the [contact page](/contact/) or at adam@zionscampbooks.com

Thanks, and happy reading!
