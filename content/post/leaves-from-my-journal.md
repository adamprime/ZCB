Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the LDS Church, details many of his experiences in this short memoir designed to give the youth of the Church instruction and encouragement as a part of the Faith-Promoting Series.

This book provides one of the best insights into early LDS history. President Woodruff shares his experiences of embracing the gospel and joining the church, his adventures as a part of Zion’s Camp with Joseph Smith and other church leaders, his callings and miracles that occurred during his many missions around the US and to England and Canada, as well as giving specific instructions to anyone interested in coming to live by the Spirit of God.

This is an incredible account written by an amazing man, one of God’s chosen servants.
