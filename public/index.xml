      <description>Words have amazing power.
All my life I have loved reading gospel books like the scriptures, church magazines, and books from church history. The Spirit can have such a powerful influence on us as we read the gospel in written form.
Many of the books written by early church leaders and pioneers have incredible, faith-building stories and teachings. Because they were published so long ago, few continue to be in print today.</description>
